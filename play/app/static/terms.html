                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>There may also be times when our Game available for technical or maintenance related reasons, whether on a scheduled or unscheduled basis.</li>

        <h2>Accounts</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>You agree that you shall take all steps necessary to protect your log in details and keep them secret. You agree that you shall not give your log in details to anyone else or allow anyone else to use your log in details or account. In these terms, references to “log in details” or “account” include your log in details and account for any social network or platform that you may allow our Game to interact with.</li>
            <li>If you fail to keep your login details secret, or if you share your login details or account with someone else (whether intentionally or unintentionally), you accept full responsibility for the consequences of this (including any unauthorized purchases) and agree to fully compensate us for any losses or harm that may result.</li>
            <li>We will not be responsible to you for any loss that you suffer as a result of an unauthorised person accessing your account and using our Game and we accept no responsibility for any losses or harm resulting from its unauthorised use, whether fraudulently or otherwise.</li>
            <li>We reserve the right to delete your account if no activity is conducted by you in relation to the account for a period of 200 or more days.

            <li>Without limiting paragraph 3.4, if we terminate or suspend your account in accordance with paragraph 7 of these terms you will lose any Virtual Currency that you may have and we will not compensate you for this loss or make any refund to you.</li>
