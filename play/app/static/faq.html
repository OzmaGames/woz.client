        <p>A collection is a set of 20 images and 250 words. When you play with a certain collection, all the images and most of the words will be randomly picked from it.

        <h2>What is a booster?</h2>
        <p>A booster is an addition to a collection. If you add a booster to a collection you get an additional 10 images and 100 words. These are integrated into your collection. You can't choose to play without a booster that you have added to a collection.</p>

        <h2>Where do I find my collections?</h2>
        <p>After you've bought a collection you will find it on the page where you start a new game. In the list of collections to play with, you can now choose it.</p>

        <h2>I can't find the words I like. Why?</h2>
